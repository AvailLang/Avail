/**
 * An [L1Operation] is encoded within a [ nybblecode
 * stream][A_RawFunction.nybbles] as an opcode followed by operands.  Opcodes less
 * than 16 are encoded as a single nybble, and the others are represented as the
 * [extension][L1_doExtension] nybble (15), followed by the opcode minus 16.
 * This supports up to 31 distinct nybblecodes, the statically most frequently
 * occurring of which should be assigned to the first 15 values (0-14) for
 * compactness.
 *
 * The operands are encoded in such a way that very small values occupy a single
 * nybble, but values up to [Integer.MAX_VALUE] are supported efficiently.
