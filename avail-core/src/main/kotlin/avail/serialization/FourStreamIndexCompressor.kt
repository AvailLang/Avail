package avail.serialization

/**
 * In the same way that a modern CPU manages a small number of prefetch streams,
 * we keep object references short (ideally one byte) by managing a small array
 * of [Int]s that point to recently accessed referenced objects.  During
 * serialization, an algorithm decides whether to reuse an existing pointer,
 * adjusting it by a small offset, or jump to a new absolute position because
 * there were no pointers close enough to produce an efficient relative
 * adjustment.  During deserialization, the pointers are used to reconstruct
 * each offset or new absolute position, and the appropriate pointer is updated
 * in exactly same way as occurred during serialization.
 *
 * When an absolute pointer is used, a [0..3] counter indicates which of the
 * four pointers should be replaced.  That counter is then incremented (mod 4)
 * to the next pointer that will be replaced.
