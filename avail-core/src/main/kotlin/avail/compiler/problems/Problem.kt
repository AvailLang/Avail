/**
 * A `Problem` is produced when encountering an unexpected or less than ideal
 * situation during compilation.  Within an interactive system, the problem is
 * presumably presented to the user in some manner, whereas in batch usage
 * multiple problems may simply be collected and later presented in aggregate.
 *
 * Subclasses (typically anonymous) may override [continueCompilation] and
 * [abortCompilation] to specify how a particular problem site can continue or
 * abort compilation, respectively. It is the responsibility of any client
 * problem handler to *decide* whether to continue compiling or abort.  By
 * default, `continueCompilation()` simply invokes `abortCompilation()`.
 *
 * @property moduleName
 *   The [unresolved, canonical name][ModuleName] of the module in which the
 *   problem occurred.
 * @property lineNumber
 *   The one-based line number within the file in which the problem occurred.
 *   This may be approximate. If the problem involves the entire file (file not
 *   found, no read access, etc.), a line number of `0` can indicate this.
 * @property characterInFile
 *   The approximate location of the problem within the source file as a
 *   zero-based subscript of the full-Unicode
 *   [code&#32;points][CharacterDescriptor] of the file.
 *   [Surrogate&#32;pairs][Character.isSurrogate] are treated as a single code
 *   point. It is *strongly* recommended that Avail source files are always
 *   encoded in the UTF-8 [character&#32;set][Charset].  The current compiler as
 *   of 2014.01.26 *requires* source files to be in UTF-8 encoding.
 * @property type
 *   The [type][ProblemType] of problem that was encountered.
 * @property messagePattern
 *   A [String] summarizing the issue.  This string will have [MessageFormat]
 *   substitution applied to it, using the supplied [arguments].
 * @author Mark van Gulik &lt;mark@availlang.org&gt;
 *
 * @constructor
 *
 * Construct a new `Problem`.
 *
 * @param moduleName
 *   The name of the module in which the problem was encountered, or `null` if
 *   no module is in context.
 * @param lineNumber
 *   The one-based line number on which the problem occurred, or zero if there
 *   is no suitable line to blame.
 * @param characterInFile
 *   The zero-based code point position in the file.  Surrogate pairs are
 *   treated as a single code point.
 * @param type
 *   The [ProblemType] that classifies this problem.
 * @param messagePattern
 *   A [String] complying with the [MessageFormat] pattern specification.
 * @param arguments
 *   The arguments with which to parameterize the messagePattern.
