/**
 * A `ModuleManifestEntry` is a short summary of an interesting definition
 * created by some module.  This includes atoms, method definitions, semantic
 * restrictions, lexers, module variables/constants, etc.
 *
 * @constructor
 * Create a [ModuleManifestEntry].
 *
 * @property kind
 *   The [Kind] of manifest entry that this is.
 * @property summaryText
 *   A short textual description of the item being defined, without mentioning
 *   the [kind].
 * @property topLevelStartingLine
 *   The first line of the top level statement responsible for adding the
 *   definition described by this manifest entry.
 * @property definitionStartingLine
 *   The location within this module of the start of the body function for this
 *   definition, or 0 if inapplicable.
 * @property bodyFunction
 *   The [A_Function] that best acts as the body of this entry, such as a method
 *   definition's body function, or a lexer definition's body function. This is
 *   null if a body is inapplicable or unavailable.  It is always null after
 *   reading a [ModuleManifestEntry] from the repository.
 * @property bodyPhraseIndexNumber
 *   The index into the current module's tuple of phrases, accessible via
 *   [A_Module.originatingPhraseAtIndex].  If this has not yet been computed,
 *   it will be `-1`, and the [bodyFunction] will be some [A_Function].  If there
 *   is no suitable body, or if it's not something that was serialized with the
 *   module, it will also be `-1`, but the [bodyFunction] will be `null`.
