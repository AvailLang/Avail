/**
 * A `ModuleManifestEntry` is a short summary of an interesting definition

 * @constructor
 * Create a [ModuleManifestEntry].
 *
 * @property kind
 *   The [Kind] of manifest entry that this is.
 * @property summaryText
 *   A short textual description of the item being defined, without mentioning

 * @property topLevelStartingLine
 *   The first line of the top level statement responsible for adding the

 * @property bodyPhraseIndexNumber
 *   The index into the current module's tuple of phrases, accessible via
