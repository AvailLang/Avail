/**
 * A `SignatureException` is thrown when a [definition][DefinitionDescriptor] of
 * a method is invalid.  This might indicate a compatibility problem between the
 * argument signature and the message name, or perhaps an inconsistency between
 * the signature and other signatures already installed in the system.
 *
 * Note that this is distinct from a [MalformedMessageException], which
 * indicates a syntactic error in the message name itself.
