/**
 * A `PerInterpreterStatistic` is an incremental, summarized recording of
 * a set of integral values and times.  It is synchronized, although the typical
 * usage is that it will only be written by a single [Thread] at a time,
 * and read by another [Thread] only rarely.
 *
 *
 * If you want to record samples from multiple processes, use a Statistic,
 * which holds a PerInterpreterStatistic for up to
 * [AvailRuntimeConfiguration.maxInterpreters] separate Threads to access,
 * without any locks.
 *

 *
 * @property count
 *  The number of samples recorded so far.
 * @property min
 *  The smallest sample yet encountered.
 * @property max
 *   The largest sample yet encountered.
 * @property mean

 * @property sumOfDeltaSquares
 *   The sum of the squares of differences from the current mean.  This is more
 *   numerically stable in calculating the variance than the sum of squares of
 *   the samples.  See <cite> Donald E. Knuth (1998). The Art of Computer
