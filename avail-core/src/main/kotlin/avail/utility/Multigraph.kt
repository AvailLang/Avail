/**
 * This is an implementation of a directed multigraph. A graph consists of a
 * collection of vertices connected by (directed) edges. A vertex v1 may be
 * connected to another vertex v2 by more than one edge, which makes this a
 * multigraph implementation. However, note that v1 and v2 can not be multiply
 * connected by the *same* edge (i.e., two edges connecting v1 and v2 must not
 * be [equal][equals] to each other).
 *
 * Multigraphs are not thread-safe, so they should be protected by some form of
 * explicit synchronization if they are to be accessed by multiple threads.
 *
 * @param V
 *   The type of vertices of the graph.
 * @param E
 *   The type of [Edge]s in the graph.
