/**
 * `A_SetBin` is a collection of values which are part of a [set][A_Set].
 *
 * Bins below a particular scale ([LinearSetBinDescriptor.thresholdToHash]) are
 * usually represented via [LinearSetBinDescriptor].
 *
 * Above that threshold, a [HashedSetBinDescriptor] is used, which organizes the
 * values into a tree based on their hash values.
 *
 * Bins are not allowed to occur inside any other data structures, such as in a
 * tuple, stored in a variable, or passed to or from a function.  Because of
 * this restriction, a single element can itself act as a bin.  This may happen
 * to represent a one-element set, or it may occur at the leaves of a tree of
 * hashed bins.
