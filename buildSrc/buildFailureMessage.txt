    ATTENTION ==========================================================
    Be sure to set AVAIL_HOME to:

    	$projectDir/distro

    And update your path to include:

    	###projectDir###/distro/bin

    For example, a user of bash might include something like the
    following in the appropriate shell config file:

    	export AVAIL_HOME=###projectDir###/distro
    	export PATH=$PATH:###projectDir###/distro/bin

    Once your path has been updated, from any directory you can launch
    the Avail workbench like this:

    	avail-dev

    Or the Avail server like this:

    	avail-server

    (The server is currently hard-wired to run on port 40000. This will
    change at some point.)

    To develop Avail code, you will also need to set AVAIL_ROOTS to a
    valid module root path. If AVAIL_ROOTS is not set, then avail-dev
    temporarily sets it to:

    	avail=$projectDir/distro/src/avail;\\
    	examples=$projectDir/distro/src/examples

    This is convenient for experimenting with Avail, but must be
    extended with custom module roots as you develop your own modules.
