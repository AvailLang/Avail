	//  - Set stdlib version
	//  - Setting the roots
	//  - Setting the repository location, but lets the system use the default
	//    location ("${System.getProperty("user.home")}/.avail/repositories/
	//  - Launch a workbench (includes set roots)
	//  - Clean repo
	//  - Unload module
	//  - Load/Build targeted module
	//  - configure `avail-server`
