"assertion test suite" is a new atom;
New test suite assertion test suite extends foundation test suite;

Test "basic assertions" in assertion test suite is
[
	Guard
	[
	 	Assert: 5 = 5;
		Assert: "foo" = "foo";
		Assert: true = true;
		Assert: 5 < 6;
		Assert: ∞ = ∞;
	]
	intercept [e : assertion-failed exception | Require: false];
];

Test "assertion failed exception" in assertion test suite is
[
 	Require:
 	[
 	 	func :: =
 	 	[
 	 	 	a : natural number,
 	 	 	b : natural number
 	 	 |
 	 	 	a = b
 	 	];
 	 	Assert: func(5,6);
 	] raises assertion-failed exception;

	Require:
 	[
	 	func :: =
	 	[
	 	 	a : boolean,
	 	 	b : boolean
	 	 |
	 	 	a = b
	 	];
	 	Assert: func(true,false);
 	] raises assertion-failed exception;

	Require:
 	[
	 	func :: =

 	 	 	b : integer
 	 	 |
 	 	 	a ≥ b
 	 	];
 	 	Assert: func(-10,62);
 	] raises assertion-failed exception;

	Require:

 	 	 	a : extended integer,
 	 	 	b : extended integer
 	 	 |
 	 	 	a ≥ b
 	 	];
 	 	Assert: func(-∞,∞);
 	] raises assertion-failed exception;
