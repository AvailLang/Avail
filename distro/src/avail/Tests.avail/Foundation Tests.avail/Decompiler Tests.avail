	f1 : function
|
	block ::= f1 → block phrase;
	f2 ::= block → function;
	c1 ::= f1's implementation;
	c2 ::= f2's implementation;

	Require: c1's nybblecodes = c2's nybblecodes;
];

/* For testing argument permutation at the top level. */
Method "subscript_②of_①" is
[
	t : tuple,
	n : natural number
|
	t[n]
];

/* For testing argument permutation below the top level. */
Method "reverseMap«_②<-_①‡,»" is
[
	pairs : <string, integer…|2>+
|
	/* Don't really bother to build a map. */
	"I like cheese"
];

Test "simple super-cast" in decompiler test suite is [
	Check round-trip for [<50,60>[(2 :: natural number)]];
];

Test "permuted super-cast" in decompiler test suite is [
	Check round-trip for [subscript (2::natural number) of <10,20>];
];

Test "inner super-cast" in decompiler test suite is [
	Check round-trip for [{(5 :: integer), 6, ("7" :: string)}];
];

Test "inner permuted" in decompiler test suite is [
	Check round-trip for [reverseMap 20<-"10", 40<-"30"];
];

Test "inner permuted super-cast" in decompiler test suite is [
	Check round-trip for
	[
		reverseMap
			20<-("10"::string),
			40<-"30",
			(60::integer)<-("50"::string)
	];
];

Method "Circles«foo»②«bar none»?③«this|that»!④_†①" is
[
	t : number,
	foo : <⊥…|0>*,
	barNone : boolean,
	thisOrThat : [1..2]
|
	<t, foo, barNone, thisOrThat>

Test "circled numbers" in decompiler test suite is
[
	Check round-trip for [Circles this 11];
	Check round-trip for [Circles that 120.1];
	Check round-trip for [Circles foo bar none this ∞];
];


/*
 * Test a regression related to super calls in L2. Given types A ⊇ B ⊇ C, and
 * implementations at each of A, B, and C, we had a super call with a C cast up
 * to an A. If the testing tree tested for a B first, the tested-false path
 * would attempt to subtract B from the register's restriction (which was a C),
 * leading to it be incorrectly bottom-typed, and therefore unavailable as a
 * read in subsequent tests and uses.
