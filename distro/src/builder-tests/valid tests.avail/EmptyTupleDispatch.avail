/*
 * Test that dispatching on two implementations of method, one for tuple, and
 * one for non-empty string, correctly dispatches to the former for the empty
 * string/tuple.
 *
 * This is a regression test for a fixed bug in
 * TupleTypeDescriptor.o_TrimType().

Method "_foo" is [a : any | "default"] : string;
Method "_foo" is [x : tuple | "[]"] : string;
Method "_foo" is [x : character+ | x] : string;
