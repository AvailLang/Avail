 * are required to support.
 *
 * <p>The purpose for A_BasicObject and its sub-interfaces is to allow sincere type
 * annotations about the basic kinds of objects that support or may be passed as
 * arguments to various operations.  The VM is free to always declare objects as
 * AvailObject, but in cases where it's clear that a particular object must
 * always be a tuple, a declaration of A_Tuple ensures that only the basic
 * object capabilities plus tuple-like capabilities are to be allowed.</p>
