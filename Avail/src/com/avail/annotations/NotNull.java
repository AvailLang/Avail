/**
 * {@code NotNull} annotation indicates that the annotated target must not
 * yield a {@code null} when evaluated. The precise meaning depends upon the
 * type of the target:
 *
 * <p><ul>
 * <li><strong>Static field.</strong> Once all {@code static} initializers have
 * run to completion, the field must not and must never again contain {@code
 * null}.</li>
 * <li><strong>Instance field.</strong> Once the invoked constructor chain and
 * all instance initializers have run to completion, the field must not and must
 * never again contain {@code null}.</li>
 * <li><strong>Method.</strong> No invocation of the method is permitted to
 * yield {@code null} as its return value.</li>
 * <li><strong>Method parameter.</strong> No invocation of the method is
 * permitted to bind a {@code null} argument to the formal parameter.</li>
 * <li><strong>Local variable.</strong> Once the local variable has been
 * initialized, it must not and must never contain {@code null}.</li>
 * </ul></p>
