/**
 * This class tracks changes to files to determine the minimum effort required
 * to recompile one or more Avail source files.
 *
 * <p>
 * The key technique is the use of large hashes which have a cosmologically low
 * probability of collision.  Hashing is applied to source code, object code,
 * and collections of other hashes.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are five associative structures that are populated on demand:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #sourceHashes} - the mapping from {@link FileVersion} to the hash
 * of the source code.</li>
 * <li>{@link #imports} - the mapping from source code hash to the list of
 * filenames specified as imports in that source code.</i>
 * <li>{@link #situations} - a map whose keys are
 * </ol>
 *
 *
 *
	-map #1 ("sourceHashes") from <filename, time stamp> to source hash
		-avoids rehashing for unchanged files.
	-map #2 ("imports") from source hash to tuple of imported filenames
		-avoids cost of re-extracting local dependencies.
		-Note: maps #1 and #2 are enough to produce the dependency graph.
	-map #3 ("situations") from <source hash, mixture of imported files' object hashes> to situation hash
		-same source with same imported object files should produce same object file (i.e., is same situation)
	-map #4 ("objectCodeHashes") from situation hash to object hash
		-multiple situations can lead to the same object hash.
	-map #5 ("objectCode") from object hash to actual object code
		-don't store equivalent object code in two places.
