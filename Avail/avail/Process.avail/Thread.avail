Body


/* Process support.  Processes in Avail are lightweight, but not manually
   scheduled like fibers.  The scheduler time-slices all ready-to-run processes
   that have the highest ready priority.  There is no provision for blocking
   other processes from running except the use of semaphores and other
   synchronization media, or by asking a process to suspend / resume.
   There is no quota system implemented yet, but eventually processes
   will be granted time-slices from their originating processes.  When a
   parent process dies, its quota is permanently distributed among its
   live children.  While a parent process is alive it may apportion fractions
   of its time slice to its children processes.  This is a form of sandboxing
   similar to pointer abstraction and garbage collection.  Even memory
   allocation may be sandboxed in this way eventually, but that's a lot
   harder.
