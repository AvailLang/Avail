/**
 * The practical abstract root of the Avail type lattice. `any` is the second
 * most senior type, inferior only to `⊤`. It includes every value available
 * to an Avail program, i.e., every Avail value except for the unexposed special
 * value nil.
 *
 * `any` is made extremely useful by the interaction of polymorphism and
 * semantic restrictions. Many algorithms can be codified once in terms of `any`
 * and then strengthened via a semantic restriction that extrapolates a
 * stronger result subtype from the static input types.
 *
 * `any` is the most general type that may appear in the following contexts:
 *
 *    - As a parameter type of a function type.
 *    - As the read type of a variable type.
 *    - As a leading type or the default type of a tuple type.
 *    - As the element type of a set type.
 *    - As the key type or value type of a map type.
 *    - As the field type of an object type.
 *    - As the type parameter of a pojo type.

/**
 * The enumeration of the special atoms `true` and `false`. All primitive
 * interrogatives use classical (Boolean) bivalence and obey the three classical
 * (Aristotelian) laws of thought.
 *
 * Bivalent logic assigns either `true` or `false` as the unique truth value of
 * every proposition. Every primitive interrogative, i.e. `boolean`-valued
 * primitive, stably answers either `true` or `false` for a given set of
 * arguments.
 *
 * The three classical laws of thought are:
 *
 *    - The law of identity: P → P.
 *      For every primitive interrogative "prim_,_,_", then
 *      "prim A, B, C = prim A, B, C". (All primitive interrogatives are
 *      stable.)
 *    - The law of noncontradiction: ¬(P ∧ ¬P).
 *      For every primitive interrogative "prim_,_,_", then
 *      "(prim A, B, C ∧ ¬prim A, B, C) = false".
 *    - The law of excluded middle: P ∨ ¬P.
 *      For every primitive interrogative "prim_,_,_", then
 *      "((prim A, B, C = true) ∨ (prim A, B, C = false)) = true".
 *
 * Therefore the primitive interrogatives satisfy classical logic.
 *
 * Note that values may be instances of many enumerations. This means that Avail
 * directly supports other logical systems, such as Kleene's three-valued logic
 * of indeterminacy, whose truth values are `true`, `false`, and "unknown".
 * Implementation of this system would proceed directly from creation of an atom
 * to represent "unknown" and the formation of a new enumeration that contained
 * the standard `true` and `false` atoms and also the "unknown" atom. New
 * logical operations could then be written in terms of this new enumeration.

/**
 * The true abstract root of the Avail type lattice. It is pronounced "top" and
 * written as the down tack (⊤) character. Every Avail value is an instance
 * of `⊤`, and every Avail type is a subtype of `⊤`.
 *
 * `⊤` is distinct from `any` in that it includes exactly one additional value:
 * the special value nil. This value does not satisfy any public protocol and
 * is not available to an Avail programmer. It is, however, implicitly returned
 * from every procedure, i.e., function whose return type is `⊤`. Thus nil is
 * the value produced iff no value is produced. The virtual machine uses nil to
 * simplify several core algorithms, but exposure of nil to an Avail programmer
 * would not yield a net good.
 *
 * `⊤` typically appears in Avail code in only a few select contexts:
 *
 *    - As the return type of a function type. In this context, it signifies
 *      that the function does not produce a value, i.e., it produces the
 *      unexposed value nil.
 *    - As the return type of a continuation type. In this context, it
 *      signifies that the continuation will not produce a value, i.e., it
 *      produces the unexposed value nil.
 *    - As the read type of a variable type. In this context, it signifies
 *      that no value may be read from the variable, i.e., the variable is
 *      write-only.
 *    - As the idempotent initial value of an accumulator variable whose
 *      intermediate and final results represent a chain of type intersections.
 *      (Note that the type intersection of `⊤` with some type X is always X.)
 *    - As the result of a semantic restriction on a procedure that serves only
 *      to reject parses based on the static types of the arguments (but does
 *      not strengthen the return type).
 *    - As the result type of a phrase. In this context, it signifies that the
 *      phrase serves as a statement (and not merely as an expression).
 *
 * A function whose declared return type is `⊤` is still permitted to answer an
 * actual (non-nil) value. This is consistent with the type lattice, since every
 * value is an instance of `⊤`. It is useful, moreover, because a semantic
 * restriction may strengthen the return type of a `⊤`-valued function at a
 * particular call site to a subtype of `⊤`.
 *
 * `⊤` is expressly forbidden from occurring in most contexts, including the
 * following:
 *
 *    - As a parameter type of a function type.
 *    - As the write type of a variable type. This also implies that it cannot
 *      be the type of an actual variable.
 *    - As a leading type or the default type of a tuple type.
 *    - As the element type of a set type.
 *    - As the key type or value type of a map type.
 *    - As the field type of an object type.
 *    - As the type parameter of a pojo type.
 *
 * Note that these prohibitions, when considered in aggregate, negate any
 * possible value that could be gleaned from exposing the special value nil to
 * an Avail program. They conspire together to ensure that nil could never be
 * retained by an Avail value. It may therefore only exist as a temporary within
 * a continuation, i.e., an item on the local stack of a function call. A
 * reflective query of a continuation''s temporaries that would answer nil will
 * instead produce a variable whose read type is `⊥`.
