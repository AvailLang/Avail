ALL TAGS WILL BE LINKS!  Either specifically called out:
	{@type "tuple" <number…|>}  First element is the token, the second is the thing to link to, the third is the text that is displayed
  or:
	"string"  this is an implied link.  string is a link directly to string.

You will be either talking about a "type" (includes class) or a "method".  These are mutually exclusive, except for @category:

Type:
	@type
	@supertype
	@field
	@category

Method:
	@param
	@raises
	@restricts
	@returns
	@forbids
	@category
	@pubilc
	@method
	@see - can be used anywhere
	@author
	@link - link off site used in {@param "a"} syntax: {@link "www.google.com"}
	@code - {@code "from 1 to 10"}

If @category is the first tag, create the super type for methodDoc and typeDoc.

Methods:
A method is default private, but is specified public IF @public.  There is a difference for "regionally public" and "globally public".
/**
 * Compute the sum of {@param "a"} and {@param "b"}.
 *
 * @method "_+_"
 * @public
 * @category "…" "…" … 
 * @param "a" "number"
 *	A number.
 * @param "b" "number"
 *	A number.
 * @returns "number"
 *	The sum.
 * @raises "cannot-add-unlike-infinities exception"
 *	If the arguments are {@code ±∞}
 * @see Everything Google {@link "www.google.com"}
 * @see Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Suess
 */


Semantic Restrictions:
    The only general description that is provided is what the semantic restriction specifically rejects.  The only components are @method and @restrict.  You may have a description of the @restriction, however this is dis-recommended. You will never name the input of the @restriction.
/**
 * Reject addition of unlike infinities
 *
 * @method "_+_"
 * @restricts "number's type"
 *
 * @restricts "number's type"
 *
 */


Grammatical Restrictions:
	The numeral after the forbid is the argument that is being restricted.
/**
 * Addition is left associative
 * @method "_+_"
 * @forbids 2 "_+_" "_-_"
 */


Class Definitions:

/**
 * A counting iterator...
 *
 * @type "counting iterator"
 * @supertype {@type "iterator" iterator of number}
 */
