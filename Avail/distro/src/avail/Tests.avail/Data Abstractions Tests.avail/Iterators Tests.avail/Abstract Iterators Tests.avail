Body

Public "iterators test suite" is a new field atom;
New test suite iterators test suite extends data abstractions test suite;

Test "for each of do" in iterators test suite is
[
	a ::= a reader over <1,2,3,4>;
	b : tuple := <>;
	For each of a do [n : natural number | b ++= <n>;];
	Require: b = <1,2,3,4>;
];

Test "macro for each of do" in iterators test suite is
[
	a ::= a reader over <1,2,3,4,5>;
	b : natural number* := <>;
	For each element of a do
	[
	 	If element is even then [b := b ++ <element>;];
	];
	Require: b = <2,4>;
];
