/**
 * An `EnvironmentConfigurator` [updates][Configurator.updateConfiguration] a
 * [compiler&#32;configuration][AvailServerConfiguration] from the environment.
 *
 * The following environment variables are used by the compiler:
 *
 *  * **AVAIL_ROOTS**: The [Avail&#32;root][ModuleRoots], described by the
 *    following grammar:
 *  ```
 *  modulePath ::= binding ++ ";" ;
 *  binding ::= logicalRoot "=" objectRepository ("," sourceDirectory) ;
 *  logicalRoot ::= [^=;]+ ;
 *  objectRepository ::= [^;]+ ;
 *  sourceDirectory ::= [^;]+ ;
 *  ```
 *  `logicalRoot` represents a logical root name. `objectRepository` represents
 *  the absolute path of a binary module repository. `sourceDirectory`
 *  represents the absolute path of a package, i.e., a directory containing
 *  source modules, and may be sometimes be omitted (e.g., when compilation is
 *  not required).
 *
 *  * **AVAIL_RENAMES**: The path to the
 *  [renames&#32;file][RenamesFileParser].
 *
 * @author Todd L Smith &lt;todd@availlang.org&gt;
 *
 * @constructor
 *
 * Construct a new `EnvironmentConfigurator` for the specified
 * [configuration][AvailServerConfiguration].
 *
 * @param configuration
 *   The compiler configuration.
