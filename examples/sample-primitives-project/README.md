SAMPLE PRIMITIVE PROJECT OVERVIEW

***NOTE: 2023.09.08 The current state of this example is: Expected to Work***

*This uses alpha version tools that are in flux. This README will be updated*
*to reflect accurate usage for the 2.0.0 production release of the Avail*
*toolchain. Once the tools are finalized, this sample will be updated to a*
*working state relative to the latest production release.*

This represents a project that creates Avail primitives in a JVM language, 
in this case, Kotlin, that is dynamically linked in Avail with Avail's 
primitive linking system. This adds new primitives to Avail that can be used in
Avail code. This project will be updated over time to reflect changes to 
Avail as well as to further demonstrate how Avail can be used in a JVM project.

_This is a work in progress!_
