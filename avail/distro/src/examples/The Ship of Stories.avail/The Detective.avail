The Detective
is described by
	"The file on your desk is labeled \"Gem Thief\". It's your only job, and
	you'd better get cracking on it if you want to pay the rent this month.

	Evidently, The Perspex Gem has gone missing from its display case in The
	Museum of Antiquities. The cops don't have a clue, and the insurance company
	has hired you to look into the case.

	Taking a good long look around your workspace, you can't help but notice
	that it's pretty bare. You're not even certain what sort of Detective you're
	supposed to be! Plucky girl detective? City gumshoe? Little old lady who
	knits and solves mysteries? It could be anything.

	This state of affairs is..."

Straight Path
is titled by "Hard at work or hardly working?"
and is described by
	"This shoddy half-told state of affairs just goes to show how desperately this ship
	needs a new Narrator at the helm!

	Well, you'll just have to soldier through, for now.

	You head off to the Museum to inspect the scene of the crime. The Curator shows you
	over to the shattered display case which used to hold The Perspex Gem, and waits
	nearby while you look around.

	You trivially spot grease stains on the glass shards, and the air is rank with some
	sort of cologne.

	It's time to question The Curator. He seems a little skittish - you might want to
	choose your questions carefully."

Sponsor
is titled by "Oh, well that makes sense."
and is described by
	"\"So, who wanted The Perspex Gem here in this particular Museum, anyway? The
	insurance company isn't giving out particulars like that.\"

	The Curator shrugs. \"Probably The Mad Scientist. That's who sponsors most of the
	exhibits here.\"

	You have to admit, there are an awful lot of lasers here in The Museum of Antiquities.

	\"I see. And where can I find The Mad Scientist?\"

	\"At the compound on top of the hill. Be careful of the beartaurs, though.\""

Accusatory
is titled by "You're such a people person."
and is described by
	"You narrow your eyes and jab The Curator in the chest. \"I'm going to need an alibi
	from you before I can rule you out as a suspect. Where exactly where you when The
	Perspex Gem was stolen?\"

	His eyes bug out, and he gasps audibly. \"How... how did you know?! I swear I'd never
	done anything like that before. I'll never do it again! Please! I don't want to lose
	my job!\""

Curator Death
is titled by "You'll never take me alive. No, really."
and is described by
	"\"Aha! So you did steal the Perspex Gem! You're going away for a long, long time, my
	friend. Where did you put it, you fiend?\"

	The Curator screeches and draws a knife! He stabs you in the gut, and as you lay dying
	amidst the shards of glass he cries out \"violence IS the answer! I lied! I'm going
	to join an angry mob and try to kill someone every night from now on!\"

	Huh. It kind of sounds like he didn't do it. Also, you're bleeding all over the floor.

	Whoops.";

Curator Confession
is titled by "Whoa there, settle down..."
and is described by
	"\"Hey, nobody's accusing you of anything. What's all this about? Why would you lose
	your job?\"

	\"Because... because I was... I was doing something else.\"

	\"Something like...?\"

	The Curator looks shifty. \"I was with some friends.\"

	This is worse than trying to pull teeth from a potato. \"Doing what?\"

	\"Look, everybody was doing it! It's not like I was the only one in the angry mob that
	night!\"

	Aha."

Mob Target
is titled by "What, they don't make good neighbors?"
and is described by
	"\"And just who was this angry mob after?\"

	The Curator seems exasperated. \"The Mad Scientist, of course. It's not exactly easy
	living near a character like that.\"

	Aha."
and has a transition
	to Scientist Investigation
	described by "It sounds like it's time to go have a chat with The Mad Scientist.";

Rabble Rouser
is titled by "Rabblerabblerabblerabble"
and is described by
	"\"You have NO idea how hard it is living here, under the tyrannical rule of The Mad
	Scientist! It's all death robots and mutant monsters and explosions all the time. You
	have to pull together under circumstances like that! I can't tell you how many times
	the person who organized the mob that night has helped me out. I'm not ratting out
	anyone!\"

	He turns his back to you and storms off. Well, solidarity and all that."

Odor
is titled by "Smells like a clue!"
and is described by
	"\"What is that peculiar odor?\"

	The Curator sniffs a bit. \"Oh, that? I hardly notice it anymore. That's just The
	Assistant's cologne. It is a bit rank, isn't it?\"

	Aha.

	\"And where can I find The Assistant?\"

	\"He helps out around here once in a while, but I haven't seen him much lately. He's
	usually up the hill at The Mad Scientist's compound.\""

Scientist Investigation
is titled by "Off to see the wizard..."
and is described by
	"You leave The Museum and take a look around outside. You spot a few discarded
	pitchforks and burnt out torches in the mud at the base of a large hill. Cantering all
	over the hill are strange half-bear half-horse creatures. At the top of the hill is a
	building that's hard to make out in any detail because it's wreathed in a perpetual
	thunderstorm.

	You have a pretty good idea where The Mad Scientist might be living."
and has transitions
	to Beartaur Death
	described by "Walk up the hill."
and
	to Directions
	described by "Ask one of the Villagers for directions.";

Beartaur Death
is titled by "Who knew mutant hybrid bear-horses would be dangerous?!"
and is described by
	"You walk up the hill, observing everything and taking notes in your trusty notebook.
	You take particular notice of the trampled grass and bloodstains. And then the
	beartars attack.

	You think you can hear The Curator tsk-tsking from down the hill as you are torn to
	shreds.

	Well, that was... kind of predictable, really.";

Directions
is titled by "I seem to have lost my map."
and is described by
	"\"Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to The Mad Scientist's laboratory?\"

	The Villager looks at you like you're an idiot.

	\"Yes, I can see the lightning-wreathed structure looming on the hill there, but I
	also noticed some fairly nasty looking creatures. Is there a way around them?\"

	\"Oh, aye. You just go around back there to the delivery entrance. The Assistant set
	that up so we wouldn't have to deal with those beasties. Such a helpful person.\"

	Aha."
and has transitions
	to Beartaur Death
	described by "Oh, this is silly. Just walk up the hill."
and
	to Delivery Entrance
	described by "Go around back to the delivery entrance.";

Delivery Entrance
is titled by "Knock-knock"
and is described by
	"You go around back to the delivery entrance. It's enclosed in a metal cage for
	safety, but does have a very nice welcome mat.

	You only have to wait a moment after knocking on the door before it opens up. \"Can I
	help you?\" This can only be The Assistant. He's wearing grease-stained work clothes
	and there's a peculiar odor about him.

	\"Is The Mad Scientist available?\"

	\"Why no. I'm afraid The Mad Scientist left town the other night - just after the
	robbery at the Museum. Perhaps there's some way I can assist you?"
and has transitions
	to Red Herring
	described by "Nope. It sounds like The Mad Scientist was definitely the thief. I'll
	just report that and be done."

	to Mob Inquiry
	described by "Inquire about angry mobs."
and

	described by "Inquire as to The Assistant's whereabouts the night of the robbery.";

Red Herring
is titled by "That's a wrap!"
and is described by
	"\"Well, I guess that cinches it! The Mad Scientist stole The Perspex Gem and then
	got out of town. I'll hire The Bounty Hunter to track him down and call this good
	enough. Thanks for your time.\"

	The Assistant looks absolutely delighted, and shakes your hand.

	You leave, whistling a jaunty tune, and go back to your office where you write a
	report, and do some filing.

	A short while later, The Assistant uses The Perspex Gem to take control of The Ship
	of Stories and becomes The Narrator. Huh.

	You might want to consider another line of work.";

Mob Inquiry
is titled by "An interesting line of inquiry"
and is described by
	"\"There was something else going on the night of the robbery: an angry mob down at
	the base of the hill. Do you know anything about that?\"

	The Assistant's eyes widen. \"A mob, you say? No, I don't know anything at all about
	that.\"

	\"Pitchforks?\"

	The Assistant shakes his head. \"We have robots that muck out the beartaur stables.
	No pitchforks here.\"

	\"Torches?\"

	\"My employer has some very impressive flashlights. I haven't much need for torches.\"

	\"Hmm...\""

	described by "Well, that seems innocent enough. Ask The Assistant about his activities
	the night of the robbery.";

Disintegration End
is titled by "Just one more thing..."
and is described by
	"\"So you really don't know anything about an angry mob trying to kill your employer?\"

	The Assistant's eyes narrow and he pushes a button on the inside of the door frame.
	The metal cage around the delivery entrance clangs shut and starts crackling with
	diabolical energy. \"You just couldn't leave it alone, could you? Well, there's just
	no helping some people.\"

	He pulls a lever, and there's a flash of green light.

	You have been disintegrated!";

Into the Fray
is titled by "I promise not to sell you encyclopedias"
and is described by
	"\"If I could just come in for a minute, have a look around...\"

	\"Oh, I really can't allow that. The Mad Scientist isn't here, and this is his home
	and all.\"

	\"I insist!\" You shove past The Assistant just as he pushes a button on the door
	frame. The metal cage around the delivery door is now crackling with diabolical energy
	and looks pretty unsafe.

	You're standing in a storage room, stacked high with boxes and crates of dubious
	materials. The Assistant looks quite angry.

	\"I don't know what gave me away, but you're not getting out of here to tell anyone
	about my crime!\""
and has transitions
	to Shelf End
	described by "Topple one of the shelves onto The Assistant."
and
	to Random End
	described by "Grab something at random from one of the boxes."
and
	to Discretion Win
	described by "Run and hide to buy yourself some time.";

Shelf End
is titled by "We all fall down..."
and is described by
	"You grab one of the unstable looking shelves and shove it towards The Assistant,
	hoping to bury him in boxes. The shelf topples over, but The Assistant's shoes
	suddenly sprout huge springs and he leaps out of the way!

	The shelf hits the ground with a resounding crash, and several of the boxes break open.
	Mechanical crabs scuttle towards you, and an oozing blue slime wraps around your left
	foot. You're stuck to the floor now, and can't move. From behind you, you hear The
	Assistant laughing maniacally.

	\"And now, Detective, we end this.\"

	You don't see what hits you, but it sure felt weird.

	On the plus side, The Assistant puts your brain in a jar and lets you wander around
	the lab on a little spider robot platform. He's quite good company once you get to
	know him.

	You failed in your mission to uncover the thief and live to tell the world about it,
	and you never got ahold of The Perspex Gem, though.";

Random End
is titled by "Random rarely works out well in these stories, you know..."
and is described by
	"You reach into a box on a shelf near you, desperate to find some sort of weapon or
	distraction. Instead, something clamps onto your hand painfully! Ow!

	The mechanical crab attached to your hand asks, in a tinny voice, if you'd like some
	toast.

	\"Mwahahahaha! I knew that would come in handy some day! And now, my pesky little
	detective friend, you are toast.\" The Assistant pulls what looks like a plastic toy
	ray gun out of his pocket. To your surprise and dismay, it fires a real ray of red
	energy at you.

	You die.";

Discretion Win
is titled by "You're a Detective, not an Action Hero"
and is described by
	"You zig, you zag, and you dash between the shelves and then duck down in a dusty
	corner. You hear The Assistant fwahahaha-ing in the distance.

	You pull out your cell phone and call the police, warning them about the beartaurs and
	the trapped delivery door, and letting them know that The Assistant is armed and
	dangerous (and quite possibly mad).

	The police arrive pretty quickly, and arrest the would-be Mad Scientist in the
	laboratory where he was working on a complicated scheme to drive you out of hiding (it
	involved a cheese sandwich, a video game controller, and a lathe, evidently). You take
	the liberty of searching The Assistant's room, and pocket The Perspex Gem for yourself
	when no one is looking."
and has a transition
	to Discretion Epilogue
	described by "Congratulations! You solved the case and obtained The Perspex Gem!
	Narration is yours!";

Discretion Epilogue
is titled by "Epilogue: Mysteries"
and is described by
	"Your time as Narrator is a little bumpy - you seem to favor mysteries with an element
	of action and danger, and putting your characters at risk like that doesn't exactly
	make you popular. You like tidy endings which tie up loose ends. Your penchant for
	locking up the bad guys at the end of your tales has a few of the Archetypes quite
	restless by the time your tenure as Narrator is over. You happily pass on The Perspex
	Gem to another, though - fair is fair, and you play by the rules.

	Congratulations!";

Assistant Inquiry
is titled by "And where were YOU..."
and is described by
	"\"So, the night that The Perspex Gem was stolen, what were you doing?\"

	\"Well, let's see. I was tinkering with some malfunctioning robots. Then The Mad
	Scientist asked me to pack a bag, and to be sure to throw in a freeze ray and some
	suntan lotion. So I did that, then I made dinner - just for me. The Mad Scientist had
	already eaten. I had macaroni and cheese and a small salad. Um... yeah, I think that's
	about it. I checked in on The Mad Scientist before I went to bed, but I couldn't find
	him. I figured it was either time for another Invisibility Serum test, or he'd already
	left on vacation and hadn't bothered to tell me.\""

Assistant Suspicion
is titled by "Lying liars and the lies they tell."
and is described by
	"\"Into the village? No, not at all. I had no need to do so.\"

	\"Not to see the exhibit at the museum or...\"

	\"Why would I do that? There's plenty to see right here, and goodness knows I have a
	lot of work to do.\""

Sensible End
is titled by "The better part of valor..."
and is described by
	"\"Yes, of course. Well, thank you for your time. I'll be going now.\"

	\"Buh-bye now.\" The Assistant shuts the door quietly.

	Once you're sure he's not lurking on the other side of it, you lift a greasy
	fingerprint off the doorknob. You're certain it will match the prints on the shards
	of the case at the museum. You walk away from the compound quickly but casually, and
	then make a call to the police, warning them about the beartaurs. You're absolutely
	certain that The Perspex Gem is in the hands of The Assistant, and that he arranged
	for an angry mob to kill his employer.

	You're on the scene when the police show up to arrest The Assistant - it takes quite
	a show of force to get him out of there - and they allow you to inspect The Perspex
	Gem to make sure it isn't a fake.

	You have caught the thief, solved the mystery, and acquired the Perspex Gem!"
and has a transition
	to Sensible Epilogue
	described by "Case closed! Good job!";

Sensible Epilogue
is titled by "Epilogue: Straight Shooter"
and is described by
	"You enjoy yourself as Narrator, showing a preference for realistic stories with no
	nonsensical elements. Practical characters with clear motivations do well under your
	tenure, and you find yourself simply refusing to tell surreal or magical stories at
	all. You're unpopular with many of the archetypes because of these decisions, but you
	don't mind. They'll have their chance at your position soon enough, though you don't
	intend to go out without a fight.

	Congratulations!";

Wonky Path
is titled by "Promising indeed!"
and is described by
	"Yes, this bodes well. The Narrator isn't paying any attention at all to this
	particular story arc. You start poking around the edges, and soon enough you find a
	Plot Hole over by the door into your office."
and has transitions

	described by "Crawl through the Plot Hole and see where it leads."
and
	to Straight Path
	described by "Ugh, this is a real mess. You're not going anywhere near that.";

Plot Hole
is titled by "Like swiss cheese, these walls."
and is described by
	"You wiggle through the plot hole and emerge somewhere strange. You are in a maze of
	twisty little passages, all alike. The walls are gray, and though it's fairly dark you
	can see well enough to navigate safely.

	You've never been in the corridors between the story rooms before - only in the Lobby.
	Fascinating!

	You can see behind you the barely developed setting you just left. You can hear someone
	singing near by to your left, and there's the sounds of a restless crowd to your
	right."

	to Princess Path
	described by "Singing, eh? Go left."
and
	to Assistant Path
	described by "Let's see what has all those people so excited. Go right.";

Princess Path
is titled by "Some kinda fairy tale"
and is described by
	"You move toward the singing, and find a plot hole into another story. You emerge in
	the bushes at the base of a tall stone tower. A woman is standing at the tower's only
	window, singing a beautiful song. A little bird is sitting on the windowsill,
	listening to the song.

	You notice a suspicious looking lady around the side of the tower. She seems to be
	having a very heated conversation with a squirrel. Finally, she nods, and the squirrel
	runs up the ivy to the windowsill and joins the bird, where it feigns interest in the
	music."

	looking rodent."

Witch Death
is titled by "Yoo-hoo, you look dangerous!"
and is described by
	"You stand up from your hiding spot in the bushes.

	\"Hey, lady! What are you up to? What's with the squirrel?\"

	The suspicious character turns toward you, glaring. \"Are you one of her suitors? You
	seem ill-mannered for a Prince, but I suppose all and sundry can seek The Princess's
	hand in marriage. In any event, you shall not have her until The Perspex Gem is
	brought to me. Go seek it out and bother me no longer.\"

	\"So that's your game. A bit obvious, isn't it? Not to mention misogynistic.\"

	\"Obvious?\" she screeches. This one's got quite a temper on her. \"My plans are both
	subtle and nefarious! And you, you are obviously intent to interfere!\"

	A bolt of green lightning comes from her hands, and sends you to the ground, writhing
	in agony. Another blast and the world goes dark.

	Whoops.";

Squirrel Death
is titled by "Hey lady!"
and is described by
	"\"Hey! You at the window!\"

	The woman stops singing and opens her eyes. The bird flies off, but the squirrel stays
	in place, and glares down at you.

	\"You might want to be careful of that squirrel there. It was just conspiring down
	here with a real shady character.\"

	She looks baffled. You're not sure she'd even noticed the fuzzy little mammal yet. The
	squirrel, on the other hand, looks about as angry as you've ever seen a squirrel get.

	\"You interfering dolt!\" It waves its tiny paws around and starts to chant. The woman
	backs away from the windowsill - she's certainly noticed the rodent now - but the
	target of the squirrel's ire is you, not her. An enormous boulder appears hovering in
	the air three feet above your head. And then falls.

	Ouch.";

Squirrel Stoning
is titled by "Rock it."
and is described by
	"You pick a nice hefty stone, take careful aim, and then toss it straight at the
	squirrel. You don't manage to hit it in the head or anything, but you thump it in the
	side, and it squeaks and runs off. Good job!

	The bird is startled off by your sudden violence, and the woman stops singing and
	opens her eyes.

	\"Hello?\"

	twists and shudders, and transforms into a giant leafy snake!

	It shakes her loose and swallows her in midair, and then turns its attention to you.
	You try to run back through the plot hole, but the bushes catch at your limbs and hold
	you in place as the green ivy snake slithers down the tower. You are devoured.

	Well, that didn't go so well for you.";

Rope Trick
is titled by "Rope Trick"
and is described by
	"\"Just a minute. I'll see if I can find anything to help.\"

	You take a good look around where you saw the woman talking with the squirrel, and
	find a coil of glowing blue rope! You carry it back around and show it to the woman
	in the window. She gives you instructions on how to activate the magic rope, and you
	anchor one end securely to the ground, and get the other up to her in the window.

	The Princess climbs down the rope and joins you on the ground!

	\"So, now what?\" you ask her.

	\"I'm not entirely certain. I'm sure there are a lot of options available to me,
	but... well, this isn't how I expected to get out of the tower. What are you going
