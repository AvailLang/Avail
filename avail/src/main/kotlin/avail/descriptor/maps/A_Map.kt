/**
 * `A_Map` is an interface that specifies the map-specific operations that an
 * [AvailObject] must implement.  It's a sub-interface of [A_BasicObject], the
 * interface that defines the behavior that all [AvailObject]s are required to
 * support.
 *
 * The purpose for [A_BasicObject] and its sub-interfaces is to allow sincere
 * type annotations about the basic kinds of objects that support or may be
 * passed as arguments to various operations.  The VM is free to always declare
 * objects as [AvailObject], but in cases where it's clear that a particular
 * object must always be a map, a declaration of `A_Map` ensures that only the
 * basic object capabilities plus map-like capabilities are to be allowed.
