/**
 * An [A_Styler] is the mechanism by which abstract styles are associated with a
 * module's phrases and tokens.  Stylers are created within the scope of a
 * module, and attached to a single [A_Method].
 *
 * At compilation time, after a top-level phrase has been compiled and executed,
 * the [send][SendPhraseDescriptor] phrase (which may be the original of a
 * macro [substitution][MacroSubstitutionPhraseDescriptor] phrase) is traversed
 * bottom-up to populate some maps from phrases and tokens to styles.  As it
 * moves up the phrase tree, parent phrases may override the base style settings
 * established by the child phrases, such as to highlight constant strings used
 * as a method name in a method definition, versus arbitrary constant strings.
 *
 * The stylers of the method referenced by the send are filtered to include only
 * those for which the defining module is an ancestor, and the most specific
 * (one that has all the others as ancestor) is chosen to style the send.  If
 * there is no such most specific module, a special conflict style is used.
