/**
 * An [A_Styler] is the mechanism by which abstract styles are associated with a
 * module's phrases and tokens.  Stylers are created within the scope of a
 * module, and attached to a single [A_Definition] (typically a method or macro
 * definition).
 *
 * At compilation time, after a top-level phrase has been compiled and executed,
 * the [send][SendPhraseDescriptor] phrase (which may be the original of a
 * macro [substitution][MacroSubstitutionPhraseDescriptor] phrase) is traversed
 * bottom-up to populate some maps from phrases and tokens to styles.  As it
 * moves up the phrase tree, parent phrases may override the base style settings
 * established by the child phrases, such as to highlight constant strings used
 * as a method name in a method definition, versus arbitrary constant strings.
 *
 * The definitions of the method referenced by the send are filtered to include
 * only those for which:
 *   1. the styler is non-nil,
 *   2. the styler was defined in an ancestor of the current module, and
 *   3. the styler's definition was also defined in an ancestor module.
 * Note that this list cannot change due to other modules being loaded
 * concurrently, but it can change when a styler is added in the current module.
 *
 * Given these definitions, a lookup tree is constructed for the [A_Method].
 * The tree is cached for the duration of the current module's loading activity,
 * and is invalidated when a new styler is added for this [A_Method].  Other
 * modules are unaffected by new stylers.
 *
 * The static types of the method arguments are used to look up the most
 * specific styler in this tree.  If none is applicable, the default styler is
 * used.  If multiple most-specific stylers apply (i.e., there are at least two
 * which have no more specific definition in the tree), a conflict is reported,
 * probably by the use of a special conflict style.  Otherwise only one styler
 * applies, and its function is evaluated to update the maps from phrases and
 * tokens to styles.
 *
 * @constructor
 *
 * @param mutability
 *   The [mutability][Mutability] of the new descriptor.
