 * The [ObjectLayoutVariant]s capture field layouts for objects and object

 * particular set of field atoms have the same variant.
 *
 * @property variantId
 *   A unique int suitable for distinguishing variants.  This may become more

 *   specific versions of code without garbage collection complexity.  It's
 *   allocated from the [variantsCounter] while holding the [variantsLock].

 *   The set of fields for which to produce an [ObjectLayoutVariant].  Only one
