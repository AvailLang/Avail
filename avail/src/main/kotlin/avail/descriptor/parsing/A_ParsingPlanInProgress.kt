 * `A_ParsingPlanInProgress` is an interface that specifies the operations that

 * [parsing-plan-in-progress][ParsingPlanInProgressDescriptor].  It's a

 * that all [AvailObject]s are required to support.
 *
 * A plan-in-progress is the combination of a parsing plan and a current
 * program counter within the plan's instructions.  The parsing plan was already
 * specialized to a specific method definition's type signature, to allow early
 * type-based filtering during parsing.
