/**
 * [ParsingStepState] captures the current state while parsing an expression.
 * It's mutable, but in the event of a fork (say, due to a [BRANCH_FORWARD]), a
 * copy must be created before the original is mutated again.
 *
 * @constructor
 *   Construct a new [ParsingStepState].
 *
 * @property start
 *   Where to start parsing.
 * @property firstArgOrNull
 *   Either the already-parsed first argument or `null`. If we're looking
 *   for leading-argument message sends to wrap an expression then this is
 *   not-`null` before the first argument position is encountered, otherwise
 *   it's `null` and we should reject attempts to start with an argument
 *   (before a keyword).
 * @property argsSoFar
 *   The message arguments that have been parsed so far.
 * @property marksSoFar
 *   The parsing markers that have been recorded so far.
 * @property initialTokenPosition
 *   The position at which parsing of this message started. If it was parsed
 *   as a leading argument send (i.e., firstArgOrNull started out
 *   non-`null`) then the position is of the token following the first
 *   argument.
 * @property consumedAnything
 *   Whether any tokens or arguments have been consumed yet.
 * @property consumedAnythingBeforeLatestArgument
 *   Whether any tokens or arguments had been consumed before encountering
 *   the most recent argument.  This is to improve diagnostics when argument
 *   type checking is postponed past matches for subsequent tokens.
 * @property consumedStaticTokens
 *   The immutable [List] of "static" [A_Token]s that have been encountered
 *   and consumed for the current method or macro invocation being parsed.
 *   These are the tokens that correspond with tokens that occur verbatim
 *   inside the name of the method or macro.
 * @property continuation
 *   What to do with a complete [message&#32;send][SendPhraseDescriptor].
