/**
 * `EnumField` annotation is used to indicate which enumeration should be used
 * to describe an integer value embedded in an integer slot that has this
 * annotation.  This is used for pretty-printing [AvailObject]s.
 *
 * @property describedBy
 *   This annotation field indicates the [Enum] responsible for describing the
 *   integer slot to which the annotation is applied.  The value of the field
 *   (an `int`) should equal an [ordinal][Enum.ordinal] of a member of the
 *   specified `enum`.  If a [lookupMethodName] is also specified then the int
 *   value may be something other than the Enum's ordinal.
 * @property lookupMethodName
 *   This optional annotation field indicates the name of a static method
 *   defined within the [describing enumeration][describedBy]. The method should
 *   take an `int` argument and return an instance of the `#describedBy()`
 *   enumeration or null.  If null, only the numeric value is displayed,
 *   otherwise the enumeration value's name is displayed.  If this annotation
 *   field is omitted, the value of the field is treated as the
 *   [ordinal][Enum.ordinal] to look up. Similarly, in this case an ordinal that
 *   is out of range will only display its numeric value.
