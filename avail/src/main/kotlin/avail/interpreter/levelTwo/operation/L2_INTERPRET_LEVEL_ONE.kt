/**
 * Use the [Interpreter.levelOneStepper] to execute Level One unoptimized
 * nybblecodes.  If an interrupt request is indicated, or if a call anywhere
 * within this code arranges to reify the fiber, return a [StackReifier], making
 * sure to synthesize a continuation for the current frame.
 *
 * Note that Avail calls are now executed as Java calls, causing this thread
 * to block until either it completes or a [StackReifier] is
 * returned, which causes an [A_Continuation] to be built, allowing the
 * Avail frame to continue executing later.
