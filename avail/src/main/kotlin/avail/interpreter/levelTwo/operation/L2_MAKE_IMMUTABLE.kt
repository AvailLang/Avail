/**
 * Force the specified object to be immutable.  Maintenance of conservative
 * sticky-bit reference counts is mostly separated out into this operation to
 * allow code transformations to obviate the need for it in certain non-obvious
 * circumstances.
 *
 * To keep this instruction from being neither removed due to not having
 * side-effect, nor kept from being re-ordered due to having side-effect, the
 * instruction has an input and an output, the latter of which should be the
 * only way to use the value after this instruction.  Accidentally using the
 * input value again would be incorrect, since that use could be re-ordered to a
 * point before this instruction.
