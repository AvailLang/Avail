 * An `L2NamedOperandType` is used to specify both an [L2OperandType] and a
 * [String] naming its purpose with respect to some [L2Operation].  This
 * effectively allows operations to declare named operands, increasing the
 * descriptiveness of the level two instruction set. The names are not used in
