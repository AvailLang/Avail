/**
 * A finite state machine (**FSM**) comprises a finite set of states, a table of
 * transitions between those states, and a table of actions to be performed when
 * states are entered, exited, or transitioned between. Each transition may have
 * a guard, allowing conditional selection among transitions for the same event.
 * A transition may have null for its event, in which case the transition is
 * traversed immediately after arriving if the guard permits.
 *
 * The FSM is parametric on the [type][Class] of states, the type of events
 * which cause transitions between states, the type of action keys, the type of
 * guard keys, and the type of argument that an action will receive. The client
 * provides each parameter for maximum type-safety and code-reuse.
 *
 * States, events, action keys and guard keys are enumerations, thereby allowing
 * the compiler to check the correctness of usages and the runtime environment
 * to validate the comprehensiveness of the FSM model. In particular, all states
 * must be reachable, all events must occur, and all action keys must be bound
 * to executable actions.
 *
 * Executable actions are keyed by members of an action key enumeration. That
 * is, states and transitions are not bound directly to actions, but rather
 * indirectly to keys. This allows optimal type-safety and automated validation.
 * An action accepts a single argument of client-specified type. This object is
 * treated as a memento by the FSM, an opaque argument supplied at
 * [execution&#32;context][ExecutionContext] creation-time and passed through to
 * an action upon its performance.
 *
 * Executable guards are keyed by members of a guard key enumeration for the
 * same reasons as actions. An executable guard accepts a single argument of
 * client-specified type, namely the same memento passed to executable actions.
 * The executable guard answers a boolean indicating whether the transition may
 * be taken.
 *
 * A new FSM is obtainable only via an appropriately parameterized
 * [factory][StateMachineFactory]. This allows incremental and arbitrary-order
 * specification of the FSM independent of any runtime assembly constraints.
 *
 * An FSM provides a single protocol operation, namely the creation of a new
 * execution context ([createExecutionContext]). Transitions are
 * client-instigated by notification of event occurrences
 * ([ExecutionContext.handleEvent]). Not every state will have a valid
 * transition on every event; should an invalid transition occur, an
 * `[InvalidTransitionException]` will be thrown. This event may be safely
 * discarded to permit continued use of the signaling execution context. Event
 * notification is thread-safe, and multiple contexts may simultaneously execute
 * on the same FSM.
