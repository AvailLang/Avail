/**
 * A [RunTree] maintains a mapping from [Long] to some value which is expected
 * to be the same for runs of consecutive [Long]s.  This is not thread-safe, and
 * should be protected with an external [ReadWriteLock] to allow readers and
 * writers to coordinate safely.
 *
 * The `null` value is treated as the absence of a run.  The [edit] method takes
 * two [Long]s representing the affected range (degenerate ranges have no
 * effect) and a function taking a [Value] or null, and returning a [Value] or
 * null to use in its place.  The function is evaluated zero or more times to
 * produce edits of existing runs, which will then be subject to the [RunTree]`s
 * normalization rules:
 *  * No empty ranges,
 *  * No `null` values in ranges,
 *  * No overlapping ranges,
 *  * Two contiguous ranges will not have the same [Value],
 *  by [equality][equals].
 *  * Ranges are not allowed to include [Long.MAX_VALUE].
 *
 * In addition, the [RunTree] is [Iterable], allowing traversal over the
 * <start, pastEnd, value> triples in ascending order.
