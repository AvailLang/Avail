/**
 * A [LeftistHeap] is a persistent (immutable) priority queue.  The [first]
 * operation is O(1), and [with] and [withoutFirst] are O(log(n)).  The latter
 * two also produce a new [LeftistHeap] without modifying the original.
 *
 * A [LeftistHeap] is either a [leftistLeaf] having no elements, or a
 * [LeftistInternal] containing the heap's minimum (the values of the heap must
 * be [Comparable]), a left subtree, and a right subtree.  The [rank] of a heap
 * is the length of the shortest path to a leaf.  The rank of a heap's right
 * subtree is always less than or equal to the rank of the heap's left subtree.
 * Therefore, the shortest path to a leaf can always be found along the right
 * spine.  In fact, the rank can be *defined* as zero for a leaf, or the right
 * subtree's rank + 1.
 *
 * @constructor
 * Construct a heap.
 *
 * @param rank
 *   The rank of the heap, which is the number of values along the right spine.
 * @param size
 *   The number of values in the heap.
