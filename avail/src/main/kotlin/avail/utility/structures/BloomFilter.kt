/**
 * A `BloomFilter` is a conservative, probabilistic set.  It can report that an
 * element is *probably* in the set, or *definitely* not in the set.  This can
 * be a useful, fast prefilter to avoid computing or fetching authoritative data
 * in a large majority of cases, effectively reducing the number of spurious
 * occurrences of the slower activity by orders of magnitude.
 *
 * Since the filter is probabilistic, the interface is defined entirely in terms
 * of [Int]s, under the assumption that the actual entity being tested for
 * membership has already been hashed.
 *
 * @param T
 *   The type of objects hashed into the filter.
