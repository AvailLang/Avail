/**
 * {@code A_MapBin} is a collection of keys and their associated values, which

 *
 * Bins below a particular scale ({@link
 * LinearMapBinDescriptor#thresholdToHash}) are usually represented via {@link
 * LinearMapBinDescriptor}, which is primarily an arbitrarily ordered
 * alternating sequence of keys and their associated values.  The hashes of the
 * keys are also stored for performance, among other things.
 *
 * <p>Above that threshold a {@link HashedMapBinDescriptor} is used, which
 * organizes the key-value pairs into a tree based on their hash values.</p>
