 * UnresolvedRootException is a type of UnresolvedDependencyException that is

 * it expected to be present. This may be caused by:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The target module name referring to a root not present in AVAIL_ROOTS,
 * or</li>
 * <li>The compiler being unable to find a root accounted for in AVAIL_ROOTS
 *     because it has disappeared from the file system</li>
