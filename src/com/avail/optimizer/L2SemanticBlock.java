/**
 * This represents the purpose for generating an {@link L2BasicBlock}.  It's
 * somewhat analogous to {@link L2SemanticValue}s, and as such it's tied to the
 * concept of a {@link Frame}.  It's also associated with a particular Level One
 * pc, but that's not fine-grained enough to identify it if an {@link
 * L1Operation} was translated in such a way that multiple blocks were
 * generated. In such a case, additional information must be provided to
 * distinguish the role of the block, say for inlining a polymorphic dispatch's
 * target definition.
 *
 * <p>The {@code L2SemanticBlock}s must be {@link Comparable} to each other
 * to ensure predecessors are always generated before successors.  To simplify
 * the queueing of the generation actions, these must form a full order that's
 * arbitrarily but stably embedded within the directed acyclic graph formed by
 * the actual dependency.</p>
 *
 * <p>The code splitting algorithm detects when a branch is being generated, and
 * looks at the dag of phi operations that provided previous, potentially
 * stronger-typed values.  If any such values would lead to the branch being
 * always-true or always-false, we consider the edge that led into the block
 * with that phi function, without exploring any earlier in that branch of
 * history.  This is the exact point where the useful information was destroyed
 * by merging control flow.  We redirect the edge to a more specialized {@link
 * L2SemanticBlock}, one that encodes the type restriction.  Since that
 * point occurs earlier in the graph than the targets of the branch that we were
 * about to create, the entire subgraph from the split point up to the branch
 * targets will be generated before the relevant branch targets, thereby
 * ensuring topological order of block generation.</p>
