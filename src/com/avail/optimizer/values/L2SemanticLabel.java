/**
 * A semantic value which represents a label continuation created for the
 * indicated {@link Frame}.
 *
 * <p>TODO MvG - It's unclear how to deal with replacement arguments provided by
 * {@link P_RestartContinuationWithArguments}.  Perhaps the approach is to
 * create a duplicate Label using a new Frame.  It would have to merge control
 * flow into a loop, so maybe this just falls under the general case of phis
 * within loops.  Or maybe it should use the very same Arguments, since a
 * semantic value doesn't have a notion of value or register <em>directly</em>
 * associated with it, only through a manifest.
