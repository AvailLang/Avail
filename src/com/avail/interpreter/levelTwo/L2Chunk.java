/**
 * A Level Two chunk represents an optimized implementation of a {@linkplain
 * CompiledCodeDescriptor compiled code object}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The chunks are held onto by weak references in a list (keyed by chunk index).
 * When a chunk expires due to not being referred to by any code or
 * continuations, its weak reference is added to a queue from which chunk index
 * recycling takes place.  The weak references also keep track of the contingent
 * methods.  The methods maintain the reverse relation
 * by keeping track of the indices of all chunks that depend on them.  When an
 * method changes (due to a method being added or removed), the
 * dependent chunks can be marked as invalid and eviscerated (to reclaim
 * memory).  When an attempt is made to use an invalidated chunk by invoking a
 * compiled code object or returning into a continuation, the reference to the
 * chunk is replaced by a reference to the default chunk (and a continuation
 * gets its offset set to the level one dispatch loop).  When all references to
 * the chunk have been so replaced, the chunk's weak reference will appear on
 * the ReferenceQueue, allowing the index to be recycled.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Eventually we can limit the number of valid chunks by linking the weak
 * references together into an LRU ring.  When adding a new chunk to a "full"
 * ring, the oldest element can simply be invalidated, removing it from the
 * ring.  The level two interpreter is already instrumented to call
 * moveToHead() at appropriate times.
