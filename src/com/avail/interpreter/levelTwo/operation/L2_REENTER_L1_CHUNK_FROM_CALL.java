/**
 * Arrive here by returning from a called method into unoptimized (level
 * one) code.  Explode the current continuation's slots into the registers
 * that level one expects.
 *
 *
 *
 * This is the first instruction of the L1 interpreter's on-ramp for resuming
 * after a callee returns.  The reified {@link A_Continuation} that was captured
 * (and is now being resumed) pointed to this {@link L2Instruction}.  That
 * continuation is current in the {@link Interpreter#reifiedContinuation}.  Pop
 * it from that continuation chain, create suitable pointer and integer
 * registers as expected by {@link L2_INTERPRET_LEVEL_ONE}, then explode the
 * continuation's slots into those registers.  The {@link Interpreter#function}
 * should also have already been set up to agree with the continuation's
 * function.
 *
 * <p>The value being returned is in {@link Interpreter#latestResult()}, and the
 * top-of-stack of the continuation contains the type to check it against.  If
 * {@link Interpreter#skipReturnCheck} is true, don't bother to do the check,
 * since it's guaranteed by the VM to be correct.</p>
