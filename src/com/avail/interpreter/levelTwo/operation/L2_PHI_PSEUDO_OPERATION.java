/**
 * The {@code L2_PHI_PSEUDO_OPERATION} occurs at the start of a {@link
 * L2BasicBlock}.  It's a convenient fiction that allows an {@link
 * L2ControlFlowGraph} to be in Static Single Assignment form (SSA), where each
 * {@link L2Register} has exactly one instruction that writes to it.
 *
 * <p>The vector of source registers are in the same order as the corresponding
 * predecessors of the containing {@link L2BasicBlock}.  The runtime effect
 * would be to select from that vector, based on the predecessor from which
 * control arrives, and move that register's value to the destination register.
 * However, that's a fiction, and the phi operation is instead removed during
 * the transition of the control flow graph out of SSA, being replaced by move
 * instructions along each incoming edge.</p>
