 * This mechanism allows type information for an {@link L2Register} to be
 * restricted along a branch. A good example is a type-testing instruction,
 * which narrows the type along the "pass" branch, but not along the "fail"
 * branch.  Eventually we may capture negative type information as well (e.g.,
 * "x isn't an integer or tuple here"), in which case we would separately narrow
 * the types for both branches.
