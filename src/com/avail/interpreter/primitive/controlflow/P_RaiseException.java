 * <strong>Primitive:</strong> Raise an exception. Scan the stack of

 * a {@linkplain FunctionDescriptor function} whose {@linkplain
 * CompiledCodeDescriptor code} is {@linkplain P_CatchException primitive
 * 200}. Get that continuation's second argument (a handler block of one
 * argument), and check if that handler block will accept {@code
 * exceptionValue}. If not, keep looking. If it will accept it, unwind the
 * stack so that the primitive 200 continuation is the top entry, and invoke
 * the handler block with {@code exceptionValue}. If there is no suitable
 * handler block, then fail this primitive (with the unhandled exception).
