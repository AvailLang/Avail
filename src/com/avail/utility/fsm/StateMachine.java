/**
 * A finite state machine (<strong>FSM</strong>) comprises a finite set of
 * states, a table of transitions between those states, and a table of
 * {@linkplain Continuation1 actions} to be performed when states are entered,
 * exited, or transitioned between. Each transition may have a guard, allowing
 * conditional selection among transitions for the same event. A transition
 * may have null for its event, in which case the transition is traversed
 * immediately after arriving if the guard permits.
 *
 * <p>The FSM is parametric on the {@linkplain Class type} of states, the type
 * of events which cause transitions between states, the type of action keys,
 * the type of guard keys, and the type of argument that an action will receive.
 * The client provides each parameter for maximum type-safety and code-reuse.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>States, events, action keys and guard keys are enumerations, thereby
 * allowing the compiler to check the correctness of usages and the runtime
 * environment to validate the comprehensiveness of the FSM model. In
 * particular, all states must be reachable, all events must occur, and all
 * action keys must be bound to executable actions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Executable actions are keyed by members of an action key enumeration. That
 * is, states and transitions are not bound directly to actions, but rather
 * indirectly to keys. This allows optimal type-safety and automated validation.
 * An action accepts a single argument of client-specified type. This object is
 * treated as a memento by the FSM, an opaque argument supplied at
 * {@linkplain ExecutionContext execution context} creation-time and passed
 * through to an action upon its performance.</p>
 *
 * <p>Executable guards are keyed by members of a guard key enumeration for
 * the same reasons as actions. An executable guard accepts a single argument
 * of client-specified type, namely the same memento passed to executable
 * actions.  The executable guard answers a boolean indicating whether the
 * transition may be taken.</p>
 *
 * <p>A new FSM is obtainable only via an appropriately parameterized
 * {@linkplain StateMachineFactory factory}. This allows incremental and
 * arbitrary-order specification of the FSM independent of any runtime assembly
 * constraints.</p>
 *
 * <p>An FSM provides a single protocol operation, namely the creation of a new
 * execution context ({@link #createExecutionContext(Object)}). Transitions are
 * client-instigated by notification of event occurrences ({@link
 * ExecutionContext#handleEvent(Enum)}). Not every state will have a valid
 * transition on every event; should an invalid transition occur, an
 * <code>{@link InvalidTransitionException}</code> will be thrown. This event
 * may be safely discarded to permit continued use of the signaling execution
 * context. Event notification is thread-safe, and multiple contexts may
 * simultaneously execute on the same FSM.</p>
