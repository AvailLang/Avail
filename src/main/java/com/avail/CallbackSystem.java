/**
 * A mechanism for adapting a Java {@link Function} into an Avail {@link
 * A_Function}.  The Java function must take an {@link A_Tuple} and return an
 * {@link AvailObject}.  The Avail function's signature is provided, and will
 * pack its arguments into a tuple for the Java function.  The Java function's
 * returned value will be checked at runtime before being returned into Avail.
 *
 * <p>If a {@link Throwable} is thrown by the Java code, it will be caught,
 * wrapped as a {@linkplain PojoDescriptor pojo} inside an Avail exception, and
 * rethrown within Avail.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the {@link AvailRuntime} that's responsible for the {@link
 * A_Fiber} doing the callback contains a {@code CallbackSystem} whose {@link
 * #callbackExecutor}'s worker threads are responsible for performing the
 * callback to the Java lambda.  Performing a long computation, significant
 * wait, or unbounded blocking may negatively affect execution of other
 * callbacks, so it's recommended that exceptionally long or blocking
 * computations be performed in some other way.</p>
