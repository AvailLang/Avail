/**
 * The {@code AbstractSlotsEnum} is an interface that helps ensure that object
 * representations and access are consistent and correct.  In particular, some
 * operations in AvailObject (such as {@link AvailObject#slot(ObjectSlotsEnum)})
 * are expected to operate on enumerations defined as inner classes within the
 * {@link Descriptor} class for which the slot layout is specified.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two sub-interfaces, {@link ObjectSlotsEnum} and {@link
 * IntegerSlotsEnum}, and the representation access methods defined in {@link
 * AbstractAvailObject} typically restrict the passed enumerations to be of the
 * appropriate kind.
