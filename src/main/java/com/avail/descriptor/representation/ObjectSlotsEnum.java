/**
 * The {@code ObjectSlotsEnum} is an interface that helps ensure that object
 * representations and access are consistent and correct.  In particular, some
 * operations in AvailObject (such as {@link AvailObject#slot(ObjectSlotsEnum)})
 * are expected to operate on enumerations defined as inner classes within the
 * {@link Descriptor} class for which the slot layout is specified.
 *
 * <p>
 * Additionally, AvailObject is implemented with both object slots and integer
 * slots in such a way that the two should not be confused; i.e., their ordinals
 * are used as indices into either an array of {@link AvailObject} or an array
 * of {@code int}.  A related interface {@link IntegerSlotsEnum} helps to keep
 * these uses disjoint.
 * </p>
