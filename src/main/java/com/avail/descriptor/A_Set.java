/**
 * {@code A_Set} is an interface that specifies the set-specific operations
 * that an {@link AvailObject} must implement.  It's a sub-interface of {@link
 * A_BasicObject}, the interface that defines the behavior that all AvailObjects
 * are required to support.
 *
 * <p>
 * The purpose for A_BasicObject and its sub-interfaces is to allow sincere type
 * annotations about the basic kinds of objects that support or may be passed as
 * arguments to various operations.  The VM is free to always declare objects as
 * AvailObject, but in cases where it's clear that a particular object must
 * always be a set, a declaration of A_Set ensures that only the basic object
 * capabilities plus set-like capabilities are to be allowed.
