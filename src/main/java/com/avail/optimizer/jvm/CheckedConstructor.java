/**
 * A helper class for referring to a constructor.  It verifies at construction time that the referenced method is marked with the {@link ReferencedInGeneratedCode} annotation, and that the specified argument types are correct.  When it generates a call, it uses the appropriate invoke instruction.
 *
 * <p>The main power this class brings is the ability to check the type signature prior to code generation, rather than have the JVM verifier be the failure point.  It also fails early if the referenced method isn't marked with {@link ReferencedInGeneratedCode}, helping to keep critical methods from changing or disappearing under maintenance.  It also keeps method names out of the code generator, making it easier to find the real uses of methods in generator code.</p>
 *
 * <p>Factory methods that indicate the method is part of the Java library are not expected to have the {@link ReferencedInGeneratedCode} annotation.</p>
