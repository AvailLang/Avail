/**
 * A ParagraphFormatter object holds a particular paragraph style in the form of
 * window width, margin, and indentation settings. It is then used to apply
 * those whitespace and word-wrap settings to a String.
 *
 * This is intended to be the final format procedure applied to a String before
 * it is output, and all adjacent, non-newline character whitespace is condensed
 * to a single space.
 *
 * @author Leslie Schultz &lt;leslie@availlang.org&gt;
 *
 * @property windowWidth
 *   The width of the output window.
 * @property leftMargin
 *   The number of spaces in the left margin.
 * @property rightMargin
 *   The number of spaces in the right margin
 * @property firstIndent
 *   The number of spaces between the left margin and the initial line in a
 *   paragraph.
 * @property restIndent
 *   The number of spaces between the left margin and non-initial lines in a
 *   paragraph.
 *
 * @constructor
 * Construct a new [ParagraphFormatter] that formats strings to wrap within the
 * supplied window width, if possible. All text is padded within the specified
 * margins.
 *
 * @param windowWidth
 *   The number of characters that can fit horizontally in the window.
 * @param leftMargin
 *   The number of spaces that all text should be, minimum,  from the left side
 *   of the screen.
 * @param rightMargin
 *   The number of spaces that all text should be, minimum, from the right side
 *   of the screen.
