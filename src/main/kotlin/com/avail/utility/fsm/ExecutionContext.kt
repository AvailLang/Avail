/**
 * An `ExecutionContext` represents a running
 * [finite&#32;state&#32;machine][StateMachine]. In order to execute a step, it
 * maintains a reference to the executor, the current state, and a
 * client-provided memento which will be passed as the sole argument of every
 * action invocation.
 *
 * To obtain a new execution context, a client should call
 * [StateMachine.createExecutionContext] on an established FSM.
 *
 * To execute a step, a client should call [handleEvent] with an appropriate
 * event.
 *
 * @param State
 *   The state type.
 * @param Event
 *   The event type.
 * @param GuardKey
 *   The guard key type.
 * @param ActionKey
 *   The action key type.
 * @param Memento
 *   The memento type.
 * @property machine
 *   The [state&#32;machine][StateMachine].
 * @property memento
 *   The memento to pass to each action that runs.

 * @constructor

 * Construct a new `ExecutionContext`.
 *
 * @param machine
 *   The [state&#32;machine][StateMachine] to instantiate as an
