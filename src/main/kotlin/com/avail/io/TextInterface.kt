/**
 * A `TextInterface` represents an interface between an external process,
 * device, or user and an Avail agent (e.g., an [AvailBuilder] or
 * [fiber][A_Fiber]). As such, it combines [input][TextInputChannel],
 * [output][TextOutputChannel], and error channels, corresponding to the usual
 * notions of standard input, output, and error, respectively. These channels
 * are each text-oriented, and constrained to operate on
 * [UTF-8][StandardCharsets.UTF_8] encoded character data.
