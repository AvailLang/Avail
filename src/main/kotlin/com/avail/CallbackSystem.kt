/**
 * A mechanism for adapting a Java [Function] into an Avail [A_Function].  The
 * Java function must take an [A_Tuple] and return an [AvailObject].  The Avail
 * function's signature is provided, and will pack its arguments into a tuple
 * for the Java function.  The Java function's returned value will be checked at
 * runtime before being returned into Avail.
 *
 * If a [Throwable] is thrown by the Java code, it will be caught, wrapped as a
 * [pojo][PojoDescriptor] inside an Avail exception, and rethrown within Avail.
 *
 * Note that the [AvailRuntime] that's responsible for the [A_Fiber] doing the
 * callback contains a `CallbackSystem` whose [.callbackExecutor]'s worker
 * threads are responsible for performing the callback to the Java lambda.
 * Performing a long computation, significant wait, or unbounded blocking may
 * negatively affect execution of other callbacks, so it's recommended that
 * exceptionally long or blocking computations be performed in some other way.
