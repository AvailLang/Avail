/**
 * This is a multi-method super-call instruction.  The opcode is followed by:
 *
 *  1. The index of the [message bundle][A_Bundle] (which itself refers to a
 *     [method][MethodDescriptor]), then
 *  2. The index of the literal that holds the expected return type for this
 *     call site, then
 *  3. A [tuple type][TupleTypeDescriptor] used to direct the method lookup.
 *
 * @property superUnionIndex
 *   The index of the literal that holds a tuple type which is used to direct
 *   method lookup.  The union of this tuple type and the type of the tuple of
 *   actual arguments at run time is used to look up the method.
 * @author Mark van Gulik &lt;mark@availlang.org&gt;
 *
 * @constructor
 *
 * Construct a new `AvailSuperCall`.
 *
 * @param relevantTokens
 *   The [A_Tuple] of [A_Token]s that are associated with this instruction.
 * @param messageIndex
 *   The index of the literal that holds the message (a
 *   [method][MethodDescriptor]).
 * @param verifyIndex
 *   The index of the literal that holds the return type.
 * @param superUnionIndex
 *   The index of the literal that holds a tuple type used to direct method
 *   lookup.
