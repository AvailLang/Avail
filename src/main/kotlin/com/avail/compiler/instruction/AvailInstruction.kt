 * `AvailInstruction` implements an abstract instruction set that doesn't have
 * to agree precisely with the actual implemented Level One nybblecode
 * instruction set.  The mapping is approximately one-to-one, however, other
 * than providing the ability to defer certain analyses, such as last-use of
 * variables, until after selection of AvailInstructions.  This allows the
 * analysis to simply mark the already abstractly-emitted instructions with
 * information that affects the precise nybblecodes that will ultimately be
 * emitted.
