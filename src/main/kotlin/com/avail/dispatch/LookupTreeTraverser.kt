/**
 * `LookupTreeTraverser` is used to enumerate the nodes of a [LookupTree].
 * Visitor methods are invoked at various stages of the traversal, and can
 * communicate at the same level by means of a traversal memento.
 *
 * @param Element
 *   The kind of elements in the lookup tree, such as method definitions.
 * @param Result
 *   What we expect to produce from a lookup activity, such as the tuple of
 *   most-specific matching method definitions for some arguments.
 * @param AdaptorMemento
 *   The adaptor for interpreting the values in the tree, and deciding how to
 *   narrow the elements that are still applicable at each internal node of the
 *   tree.
 * @param TraversalMemento
 *   The type of memento to pass between the `visit*` methods while traversing
 *   the tree.
 * @property adaptor
 *   The [LookupTreeAdaptor] with which to interpret the tree.
 * @property adaptorMemento
 *   A contextual parameter to assist the [adaptor].
 * @property expandAll
 *   Whether this traverser should expand every encountered internal node.
 * @author Mark van Gulik &lt;mark@availlang.org&gt;
 *
 * @constructor
 *
 * Create a new lookup tree traverser.
 *
 * @param adaptor
 *   The [LookupTreeAdaptor] with which to interpret the tree.
 * @param adaptorMemento
 *   A contextual parameter for the adaptor.
 * @param expandAll
 *   Whether to force expansion of every path of the tree.
