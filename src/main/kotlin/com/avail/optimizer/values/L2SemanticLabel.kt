/**
 * A semantic value which represents a label continuation created for the
 * indicated [Frame].
 *
 * TODO MvG - It's unclear how to deal with replacement arguments provided by
 *  [P_RestartContinuationWithArguments].  Perhaps the approach is to create a
 *  duplicate Label using a new Frame.  It would have to merge control flow into
 *  a loop, so maybe this just falls under the general case of phis within
 *  loops. Or maybe it should use the very same Arguments, since a semantic
 *  value doesn't have a notion of value or register *directly* associated with
 *  it, only through a manifest.
 *
 * @constructor
 * Create a new `L2SemanticLabel` semantic value.
 *
 * @param frame
 *   The frame for which this represents a label.
