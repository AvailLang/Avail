/**
 * A helper class for referring to a constructor.  It verifies at construction
 * time that the referenced method is marked with the
 * [ReferencedInGeneratedCode] annotation, and that the specified argument types
 * are correct.  When it generates a call, it uses the appropriate invoke
 * instruction.
 *
 * The main power this class brings is the ability to check the type signature
 * prior to code generation, rather than have the JVM verifier be the failure
 * point.  It also fails early if the referenced method isn't marked with
 * [ReferencedInGeneratedCode], helping to keep critical methods from changing
 * or disappearing under maintenance.  It also keeps method names out of the
 * code generator, making it easier to find the real uses of methods in
 * generator code.
 *
 *
 * Factory methods that indicate the method is part of the Java library are not
 * expected to have the [ReferencedInGeneratedCode] annotation.
