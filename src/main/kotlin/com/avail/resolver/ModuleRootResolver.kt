/**
 * `ModuleRootResolver` declares an interface for accessing Avail [ModuleRoot]s
 * given a [URI]. It is responsible for asynchronously retrieving, creating,
 * deleting, and saving files and packages where the `ModuleRoot` is stored.
 *
 * It is responsible for producing [ResolverReference]s, the object linking a
 * resource in a module root to its actual file at the [URI] location of the
 * module root.
 *
 * All file actions are conducted via the [ModuleRootResolver.fileManager].
 * Given the files may originate anywhere from the local file system to a remote
 * database accessed via network API, a RESTful webserver, etc., all file
 * requests must be handled asynchronously.
 *
 * A `ModuleRootResolver` establishes access to a `ModuleRoot` based upon the
 * [URI.scheme] given the appropriate `ModuleRootResolver` that supports the
 * scheme. A `ModuleRootResolver` is created by a corresponding
 * [ModuleRootResolverFactory]. For each `ModuleRootResolver` type implemented a
 * `ModuleRootResolverFactory` must be implemented to enable resolver creation.
 * The `ModuleRootResolverFactory` must be
 * [registered][ModuleRootResolverRegistry.register] in the
 * [ModuleRootResolverRegistry]. A `ModuleRootResolver` cannot be created if
 * the factory has not been registered. Only one registered
 * `ModuleRootResolverFactory` is allowed per `URI` scheme.
