/**
 * This class assists with the presentation of [AvailObject]s in the IntelliJ
 * debugger.  Since AvailObjects have a uniform structure consisting of a
 * [descriptor][AbstractDescriptor], an array of `AvailObject`s, and an array of
 * `long`s, it is essential to the understanding of a hierarchy of Avail objects
 * that they be presented at the right level of abstraction, including the use
 * of symbolic names for conceptual subobjects.
 *
 * `[`The following steps are for Eclipse, but there's a similar mechanism for
 * IntelliJ.]
 *
 * Eclipse is still kind of fiddly about these presentations, requiring explicit
 * manipulation through dialogs (well, maybe there's some way to hack around
 * with the Eclipse preference files).  Here are the minimum steps by which to
 * set up symbolic Avail descriptions:
 *
 * 1. Preferences...  Java  Debug  Logical Structures
 *
 *    Add:
 *    * Qualified name:
 *      com.avail.descriptor.representation.AvailIntegerValueHelper
 *    * Description: Hide integer value field
 *    * Structure type: Single value
 *    * Code: `return new Object[0];`
 *
 * 1. Preferences...  Java  Debug  Logical Structures
 *
 *     Add:
 *    * Qualified name: com.avail.descriptor.representation.AvailObject
 *    * Description: Present Avail objects
 *    * Structure type: Single value
 *    * Code: `return describeForDebugger();`
 *
 * 1. Preferences...  Java  Debug  Logical Structures
 *
 *    Add:
 *    * Qualified name: com.avail.interpreter.execution.Interpreter
 *    * Description: Present Interpreter as stack frames
 *    * Structure type: Single value
 *    * Code: `return describeForDebugger();`
 *
 * 1. Preferences...  Java  Debug  Logical Structures
 *
 *    Add:
 *    * Qualified name:
 *      com.avail.descriptor.representation.AvailObjectFieldHelper
 *    * Description: Present helper's value's fields instead of the helper
 *    * Structure type: Single value
 *    * Code: `return value;`
 *
 * 1. Preferences...  Java  Debug  Detail Formatters
 *
 *    Add:
 *    * Qualified type name:
 *      com.avail.descriptor.representation.AvailObjectFieldHelper
 *    * Detail formatter code snippet: `return name();`
 *    * Enable this detail formatter: (checked)
 *    * (after OK) Show variable details: As the label for all variables
 *
 * 1. In the Debug perspective, go to the Variables view.  Select the tool bar
 *    icon whose hover help is Show Logical Structure.
 *
 * @param parentObject
 *   The object containing the value.
 * @param slot
 *   The [slot][AbstractSlotsEnum] in which the value occurs.
 * @param subscript
 *   The optional subscript for a repeating slot.  Uses -1 to indicate this is
 *   not a repeating slot.
 * @param value
 *   The value being presented in that slot.
 * @param forcedName
 *   When set to non-`null`, forces this exact name to be presented, regardless
 *   of the [value].
 * @param forcedChildren
 *   When set to non-`null`, forces the given [Array] to be presented as the
 *   children of this node in the debugger.
